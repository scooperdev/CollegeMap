while this is not a python web app, this will still serve as instructions to build and run the web app.

you need:

nodejs npm

(sudo apt install nodejs npm) - example install script for npm for ubuntu

for set up, do:

npm install

and then, to set up the database, do:
chmod +x run-db.sh

after all of that setup, you can start the app by running:

./run-db.sh
npm run dev

then, once opening the link to the hosted web app on your local machine, you can test the app for yourself.
be sure to run docker stop college-map-db when you are done with the app!
